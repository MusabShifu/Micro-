A 62-year-old man presents with a 24-hour history of worsening abdominal symptoms. Initially, he experienced constipation, which he attributed to dietary changes. Over the next several hours, his abdomen became noticeably distended. He then began to feel cramping abdominal pain that gradually intensified, becoming more severe and constant. The pain is due to the increased pressure on the intestinal walls and the stretching of the peritoneum. Eventually, the patient started vomiting, first with undigested food and later with a more fecal odor, indicating a blockage in the lower part of the large bowel. 

The sequence of symptoms—constipation, abdominal distension, pain due to peritoneal stretching, and vomiting—suggests a large bowel obstruction. Immediate medical evaluation and intervention are necessary to prevent further complications.
